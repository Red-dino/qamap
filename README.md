Can software be built by a graph of questions and answers?

I don't know, but this program can help you try. The idea is that you start with an overarching question, then ask clarifying questions until you have a question you can answer with a terminal leaf node. Once you've answered all your questions, you start implementing the leaf nodes.  

TODO:
- Allow creation of answers. Currently, you only get the starting answer and newly created boxes are questions.
- Make the screen scrollable.
- Expand boxes with a lot of text.

I did the original work for this project in April 2023.
